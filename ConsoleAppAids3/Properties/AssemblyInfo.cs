    File Name:          AssemblyInfo.cs

    Synopsis:           This AssemblyInfo file belongs to Visual Studio project
                        ConsoleAppids3.

    Remarks:            I don't usually include revision histories in my
                        AssemblyInfo files. This is an exception, because the
                        version update is to account for a change that affects
                        only the related C Sharp project file. Hence, I won't
                        routinely update this history.

    Revision History
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Date       Version By  Synopsis
    ---------- ------- --- -----------------------------------------------------
	2016/05/20 6.1     DAG Synchronize this version number with that of its
                           dependent library, WizardWrx.DllServices2.dll.

	2016/06/09 6.3     DAG Keep the version numbers of DllServices2 and this
                           library in sync; this upgrade also covers technical
                           clarifications in the internal documentation.

	2017/08/05 7.0     DAG Replace the WizardWrx.DllServices2.dll monolith with
	                       the constellation of DLLs that replaced it, which
	                       also requires upgrading the target framework version.

	2018/08/06 7.0     DAG Manually update the copyright year to coincide with a
	                       new build against the final release candidate of the
	                       main WizardWrx class library constellation.

	2018/11/26 7.0     DAG Eliminate the unreferenced system namespaces, and tag
                           my own assembly references with explanatory notes.
