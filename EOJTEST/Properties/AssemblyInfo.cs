    File Name:          AssemblyInfo.cs

    Synopsis:           This AssemblyInfo file belongs to Visual Studio project
                        EOJTEST, which is part of solution ConsoleAppAids2.

    Remarks:            I don't usually include revision histories in my
                        AssemblyInfo files. This is an exception, because the
                        version update is to account for a change that affects
                        only the related C Sharp project file. Hence, I won't
                        routinely update this history.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Revision History
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Date       Version By  Synopsis
    ---------- ------- --- -----------------------------------------------------
    2014/05/20 4.1     DAG Promote version number from 3.0 to 4.1. The only
                           change is a new reference, WizardWrx.DLLServices.
                           This change is confined to EOJTEST.csproj, which
                           keeps the reference list.

    2014/06/06 5.0     DAG Promote version number from 4.2 to 5.0, This
                           promotion is part of a major reorganization of the
                           WizardWrx namespace.

    2014/12/15 5.4     DAG Swap the order of the calls to the WaitForCarbonUnit
                           and DisplayEOJMessage methods, so that the end-of-job
                           message s displayed before the carbon unit prompt.

                           The changes in this module are entirely cosmetic, as
                           the changes made in the test subject are internal.
                           Hence, the testing protocol is unchanged.

	2016/05/20 6.1     DAG Synchronize this version number with that of its
                           dependent library, WizardWrx.DllServices2.dll.

	2016/06/09 6.3     DAG Keep the version numbers of DllServices2 and this
                           library in sync; this upgrade also covers technical
                           clarifications in the internal documentation.

	2017/08/05 7.0     DAG Replace the WizardWrx.DllServices2.dll monolith with
	                       the constellation of DLLs that replaced it, which
	                       also requires upgrading the target framework version.

	2018/08/06 7.0     DAG Manually update the copyright year to coincide with a
	                       new build against the final release candidate of the
	                       main WizardWrx class library constellation.

	2020/10/23 7.2     DAG Implement Semantic Version Numbering. This build also
                           incorporates the current stable versions of the
                           WizardWrx .NET API asseblies, which finally fully
                           implement Semantic Version Numbering as of a few days
                           ago.

	2021/05/02 8.0     DAG Update the version number to match assemblises in the
                           solution, and pull dependencies from the global NuGet
                           repository.

    2021/06/06 8.0.535 DAG Build against the most recent WizardWrx .NET API
                           library constellation.
